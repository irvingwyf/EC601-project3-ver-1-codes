# EC601-project3-ver-1-codes
## In order to reproduce the result of the original code provided by SincNet,
## I have made changes to all the related codes to avoid using CUDA since my 
## macbook cannot use GPU to do the operations. After I forced the training
## process into using CPU, it takes forever to even process one data analysis.
## So I gave up these codes and change to the version number two.
